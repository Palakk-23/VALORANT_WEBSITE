        <h1>ABOUT GAME _________</h1>
        <h2>VALORANT</h2>
        <p>Valorant (stylized as VALORANT) is a free-to-play first-person hero shooter developed and published<br> 
           by Riot Games,for Microsoft Windows. First teased under the codename Project A in October 2019, the<br> 
           game began a closed beta period with limited access on April 7,2020, followed by an official release<br> 
           on June 2, 2020 . The development of the game started in 2014 .  Valorant takes inspiration from the <br> 
           Counter-Strike series of tactical shooters, borrowing several mechanics such as the buy menu, spray<br>
           patterns, and inaccuracy while moving.</p>
        
        <h1>GAMEPLAY _________</h1>  
        <p>Valorant is a team-based first-person hero shooter set in the near future.Players play as one of a set<br> 
            of Agents,characters designed based on several countries and cultures around the world.In the main game<br> 
            mode, players are assigned to either the attacking or defending team with each team having five players<br> 
            on it. Agents have unique abilities, each requiring charges, as well as a unique ultimate ability that<br> 
            requires charging through kills,deaths,orbs,or objectives.Every player starts each round with a"classic"<br> 
            pistol and one or more "signature ability" charges.Other weapons and ability charges can be purchased using<br>
            an in-game economic system that awards money based on the outcome of the previous round, any kills the player<br> 
            is responsible for, and any objectives completed. The game has an assortment of weapons including secondary <br>
            guns like sidearms and primary guns like submachine guns, shotguns, machine guns, assault rifles and sniper<br>
            rifles.There are automatic and semi-automatic weapons that each have a unique shooting pattern that has to be<br>
            controlled by the player to be able to shoot accurately.It currently offers 19 agents to choose from.They are<br> 
            Brimstone, Viper, Omen,Cypher, Sova, Sage, Phoenix, Jett, Raze, Breach, Reyna, Killjoy, Skye, Yoru, Astra, KAY/O,<br>
            Chamber, Neon, and Fade.</p>
        <h2>UNRATED</h2>
        <p>In the standard non-ranked mode, the match is played as best of 25 - the first team to win 13 rounds wins <br>
           the match.The attacking team has a bomb-type device called the Spike. They must deliver and activate the <br>
           Spike on one of the multiple specified locations (bomb sites). If the attacking team successfully protects<br> 
           the activated Spike for 45 seconds it detonates, destroying everything in a specific area, and they receive<br> 
           a point. If the defending team can deactivate the spike, or the 100-second round timer expires without the<br> 
           attacking team activating the spike,the defending team receives a point.If all the members of a team are<br> 
           eliminated before the spike is activated,or if all members of the defending team are eliminated after the<br> 
           spike is activated, the opposing team earns a point.If both teams win 12 rounds, sudden death occurs, in<br> 
           which the winning team of that round wins the match, differing from overtime for competitive matches.<br>
           Additionally, if after 4 rounds, a team wishes to forfeit that match, they may request a vote to surrender.<br> 
           If the vote is unanimous, the winning team gets all the victory credit for every round needed to bring them<br> 
           to 13,with the forfeiting team receiving losing credit.A team gets only two chances to surrender: one as the<br>
           attackers and the other as the defenders.</p>
        <h2>SPIKE RUSH</h2>   
        <p>In the Spike Rush mode, the match is played as best of 7 rounds - the first team to win 4 rounds wins the<br> 
           match. Players begin the round with all abilities fully charged except their ultimate, which charges twice<br>
           as fast as in standard games.All players on the attacking team carry a spike, but only one spike may be activated<br> 
           per round. Guns are randomized in every round and every player begins with the same gun.Ultimate point orbs in <br>
           the standard game are present, but there are multiple power-up orbs instead.</p>
        <h2>COMPETITIVE</h2>   
        <p>Competitive matches are the same as unranked matches with the addition of a win-based ranking system that <br>
            assigns a rank to each player after 5 games are played. Players are required to win at least 10 unrated <br>
            matches before being able to play competitive matches.In July 2020, Riot introduced a "win by two" condition<br> 
            for competitive matches, where instead of playing a single sudden death round at 12-12, teams will alternate<br> 
            playing rounds on attack and defense in overtime until a team claims victory by securing a two-match lead. <br>
            Each overtime round gives players the same amount of money to purchase guns and abilities, as well as approximately<br> 
            half of their ultimate ability charge. After each group of two rounds, players may vote to end the game in a draw,<br> 
            requiring 6 players after the first set, 3 after the second, and thereafter only 1 player to agree to a draw.<br> 
            The competitive ranking system ranges from Iron to Radiant.Every rank except for Radiant has 3 tiers.Immortal & <br>
            Radiant are reserved for top 500 players in which there is a number associated to their rank allowing players <br>
            in the top 500 to have a metric in which they can compare how they rank up to others at their level</p>
        <h2>DEATHMATCH</h2>
        <p>The Deathmatch mode was introduced on August 5, 2020.[16] 14 players enter a 9-minute free-for-all match<br> 
            and the first person to reach 40 kills or the player who has the most kills when time is up wins the match.<br> 
            Players spawn in with a random agent, and all abilities are disabled during the match which indulges pure<br> 
            gunplay. Green health packs drop on every kill, which set the player at maximum health,armor, and ammunition,<br>
            unless the player is using a machine gun, which only gives the player an additional 30 bullets.</p>
        <h2>ESCALATION</h2>  
        <p>The Escalation gamemode was introduced on February 17, 2021[18] and is similar to the "gungame" concept<br> 
            found in Counter-Strike and Call of Duty: Black Ops, though it is team-based rather than free-for-all with<br> 
            5 players on each team. The game will pick a random selection of 12 weapons to move through. As with other<br> 
            gungame versions,a team needs to get a certain number of kills to advance to the next weapon and the weapons<br> 
            get progressively worse as the team moves through them.[19] There are two winning conditions, if one team<br> 
            successfully goes through all 12 levels, or if one team is on a higher level than the opposing team within<br> 
            10 minutes. Just like Deathmatch,players spawn in as a random agent, unable to use abilities, as the gamemode<br> 
            is set for pure gun fights. Though,abilities like Sova's shock darts, Raze's boom bot, and rocket launcher, are<br> 
            abilities that everyone gets to use as a weapon. After a kill, green health packs drop, which replenishes the<br> 
            player's health, armor, and ammo to its maximum.The gamemode also has auto respawns on, respawning players in <br>
            random locations around the map</p> 
        <h2>REPLICATION</h2>    
        <p>The Replication gamemode went live on May 11, 2021.[21] During the agent select, players vote on which agent<br>
            they would want to play as. At the end of the time, or after everyone has voted, the game randomly selects <br>
            one of the player's votes. The entire team will then play as that agent, even if one of the players has not <br>
            unlocked that agent. It is a best of nine, with the players switching sides after the fourth round. Players<br> 
            can buy guns and shields with a pre-set number of credits.Abilities are pre-bought. Weapons and shields are<br> 
            reset every round</p>
        <h2>SNOWBALL FIGHT</h2>
        <p>Snowball Fight is a limited-time gamemode that was released on December 15, 2020, and is only available<br>
           during Christmas season.It is a Team Deathmatch game mode, with 50 kills to win.Abilities are not allowed<br> 
           to be used, and players spawn in as a random agent. The only weapon available is the snowball launcher, which<br> 
           is an instant kill, but slow, and uses a projectile-based arc. There is infinite ammo.Throughout the game a<br> 
           "portal" will spawn, delivering gifts, which each contain a random power up.</p> 
        <h1>AGENTS _________</h1>
        <p>There are a large variety of playable agents available in the game. Agents are divided into 4 roles:<br> 
           Duelists, Sentinels.Initiators, and Controllers. Each agent has a different role which indicates how the<br> 
           agent is usually played.</p>
        <h2>DUELISTS</h2>   
        <P>Duelists specialize in attacking and entering a bomb site for the team. Riot's official definition<br> 
           for duelists is "self-sufficient fraggers."Duelists mainly create space for their team while entering<br> 
           onto a site, giving their teammates information, and making entering a site easier. Their abilities<br> 
           tend to consist of flashes which blind enemies, and movement-based abilities that allow for them to<br> 
           cover large distances faster than other agents. This type of ability kit allows for duelists to shine<br> 
           best when they are able to catch players off guard and get impact frags.On attack, duelists are most<br> 
           often expected to play forward, leading the attack. They are expected to be in front of everyone to get<br> 
           opening picks on enemies since their abilities often give them a competitive advantage when gunfighting<br> 
           an enemy.On defense, duelists will be holding choke points where enemies try to enter sites. Due to the<br> 
           mobility in their kits, they are able to get a pick and reposition, giving their team a numbers advantage.<br>
           <b>Duelists include Jett, Phoenix, Raze, Reyna, Yoru, and Neon.</b></P>
        <h2>SENTINELS</h2>
        <p>Sentinels are the defensive line, which specializes in locking down sites and protecting teammates<br> 
           from enemies. Their abilities mainly consist of static 'objects' that are obstacles to the enemies.<br> 
           These objects can give the team valuable information and/or deal damage.On attack, sentinels can use<br> 
           their abilities to cut off certain parts of the map or set up 'objects' that can ensure the enemy cannot <br>
           flank without being noticed.On defense, sentinels can use their abilities to slow enemies from entering<br> 
           a site. This provides valuable time for the sentinels' team members to come and provide defensive support.<br>
           <b>Sentinels include Chamber, Cypher, Killjoy, and Sage</b></p>
        <h2>INITIATORS</h2>
        <p>Initiators plan out the offensive pushes. Initiators specialize in breaking through defensive enemy <br>
           positions. Initiators' abilities can consist of flashes but also abilities that can reveal the location<br> 
           of enemies. This information allows for attackers to know where enemies are and make taking a site easier.<br>
           On defense, initiators can use their abilities to help their teammates retake a lost site.<br>
           <b>Initiators include Breach, KAY/O, Skye, Sova, and Fade</b></p>
        <h2>CONTROLLERS</h2>
        <P>Controllers specialize in "slicing up dangerous territory to set their team up for success."They use <br>
           their abilities to create coverage or clear out areas of space with crowd control.To help their team<br> 
           enter into enemy territory, their abilities can consist of smokes, slows, stuns, and flashes. With their<br> 
           smokes, controllers can control sightlines on the map, making it safer to move through the map without<br> 
           getting seen.On offense, controllers can smoke off certain sightlines and use their crowd control on <br>
           common defensive spots to force enemies into the open.On defense, controllers can smoke and/or use <br>
           crowd control on entryways to delay or discourage the enemy team from moving forward.<br>
           <b>Controllers include Astra, Brimstone, Omen, and Viper.</b></P>
